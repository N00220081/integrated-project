Retailers of hardwood flooring and flatpack furniture have been caught sourcing illegal wood in their supply chains. And every winter, parks located in or near cities report the theft of fir boughs and pine trees, felled for Christmas trees.\n\nBut the most common motivation identified in my research was to supply firewood. Stories coming from Germany\'s forests echo those in my home province, where Douglas fir is often poached near roadways that cut through public conservation land. There\'s often evidence that these trees have been cut into blocks right where they fell, then loaded into the back of a truck and driven off. In rural areas, where it\'s not uncommon for homes to be heated by multiple stoves as opposed to central heating, this poached wood often feeds the burners in local communities. But now, in the long shadow of both the energy and cost of living crises, the demand for firewood is on the rise. The market for poached wood is expanding.\n\nIn the UK, the demand for wood heat has been tangible: wood stove sales have increased by 40%, and chainsaw sales have followed in lockstep. In Dorset, £10,000-worth ($12,000/€11,300) of wood was stolen from a Wildlife Trust site in early January. \"\n', 'Lyndsie Bourgon\r\n', '2023-03-02', '10:57:00', './images/19.webp', 100),

In part, that\'s because Kong himself was made for the movies. Unlike Dracula, Frankenstein\'s creature and other such fiends, he didn\'t emerge from a novel or a folk tale. The idea of an overgrown, awe-inspiring ape was conceived as a purely cinematic spectacle by Merian C Cooper, who co-directed the film with his friend Ernest B Schoedsack. The men were already well known for their silent documentaries, Grass (1925), and Chang (1927), featuring exotic animals in far-off lands, but Cooper fancied making a fictional \"terror gorilla picture\". All he needed was \"a chariot race\", he recalled (as quoted in Celluloid Skyline by James Sanders), meaning a climactic sequence to compare with the frenetic chariot race in 1925\'s Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ. One day in New York, he saw a plane flying past a skyscraper, and realised that he could add his gorilla to the tableau. \"And I remember saying aloud to myself, \'Well, if that isn\'t a chariot race, I don\'t know what is.\'\"\r\n', 'Nicholas Barber\r\n', '2023-03-02', '14:12:00', './images/9.webp', 106),

Their earnings, in many cases, have stalled or fallen relative to men’s, and in many pockets of the labour market, women still struggle to climb to critical leadership positions. More women than men are leaving their jobs, unable to navigate corporate structures while balancing commitments outside of paid work.\r\n\r\nBut buried in the narrative of women’s recent struggles overall is another critical and often even more troubling storyline: the experiences of women of colour.\r\n\r\nAlthough much gender-based data and research is reported in binary terms – men versus women – women’s lived experiences are formed at the intersection of gender and race, or ethnicity. Simply, looking at women as a monolith can lose nuance: the struggles of a white woman in the workforce may not necessarily be comparable – or even at all similar – to those of a black working woman; and, in turn, a black working woman may tend to face entirely different barriers to those experienced by women of Middle Eastern, Hispanic or Asian descent.\"\r\n', 'Josie Cox\r\n', '2023-03-01', '12:45:00', './images/10.webp', 107),
